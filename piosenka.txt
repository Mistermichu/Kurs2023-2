Brushes with darkness won't help you create
Your destiny of self but ARTPOP could mean anything, anything
I try to sell myself but I am really laughing
Because I just love the music, not the bling
Music, not the bling
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)
Free my mind, ARTPOP
You make my, heart stop
